"""Tool *descriptors* for the CLI-ReAct agent.

These exist for prompt rendering, planning, and trajectory metadata (name /
description / inputs). They are **not** executed via ``forward`` — the CLIAgent
dispatches each tool name to a CLI subprocess (see [cli_agent.py]) and observes
its stdout. ``forward`` is therefore a stub kept only to satisfy the Tool base.
